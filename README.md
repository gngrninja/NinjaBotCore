NinjaBot is a Discord bot written in C#. 

It's primary focus was to help out guilds in World of Warcraft.
I will be shifting to more administrative / Discord tasks for the time being as I am no longer actively playing World of Warcraft.

This project has been an awesome way for me to learn C#, feel free to toss in a pull request if there's a better way to do something!

Updates will be coming for Dragonflight! Stay tuned.

## Getting Started
(note)
Blizzard has recently changed their API a bit. I am re-working NinjaBot accordingly. 
Some commands have not been worked over, but the core functionality should still be there.
That include guild associations, and log posting for retail and classic. (conversion to local timezones for logs will have to be re-added at a later date)

Outside of that, there may be issues, and I will be fixing them as I see them come up.

The first thing you'll need to do is [invite the bot to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=238495040446398467&scope=bot&permissions=314432). 
It will need permissions to read and post messages at the very minimum. 
If you wish to use NinjaBot to assist with admin tasks (kicking/banning users, message management, etc), [please use this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=238495040446398467&scope=bot&permissions=27718).

There are a limited number of classic WoW commands now available. You can associate your guild, and watch/get logs from Warcraft logs. 
Currently there is no way to get classic armory or guild information via the API, and I'll be watching to see when/if things get added!

More information on the bot and getting started [here](https://www.gngrninja.com/bot).

### Associating your guild (Retail WoW)
Associating a WoW guild with your Discord server allows you to use the Warcraft Logs watching command, as well as some autocomplete features for guild member names when using various WoW commands.

To associate your guild with NinjaBot, use the following command:
```
!set-guild realmName, guildName, region
```
Here are some examples of using the command:
### US (also the default if no region is specified)
```
!set-guild Destromath, NinjaBread Men, us
```
### EU
``` 
!set-guild Silvermoon, Rome in a Day, eu
```
### RU
```
!set-guild Ревущий фьорд, Порейдим месяц, ru
```

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gngrninja/NinjaBotCore/Dev/media/set-guild.PNG)
### Associating your guild (Classic WoW)

To associate your classic WoW guild with NinjaBot, use the following command:
```
!set-guildc "guild name" "realm" "region"
```

Valid regions:
US, EU, KR, TW, and CN

NinjaBot will associate what you enter as the guild attached to your server. That data will then be used to watch / retrieve logs from Warcraft Logs.

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gngrninja/NinjaBotCore/Dev/media/set-guildc.png)

Example:
### US (also the default if no region is specified)
```
!set-guildc "Disorder" "Rattlegore"
```
## WoW Commands

### [Warcraft Logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com) Auto Log Poster (Retail and Classic)

To use the auto log poster, use this command in the channel you want them automatically posted to:
```
!watch-logs
```

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gngrninja/NinjaBotCore/Dev/media/watch-en.PNG)

You can use the same exact command to disable the auto log posting, and then use it again to enable it (in the channel you want them posted to).

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gngrninja/NinjaBotCore/Dev/media/watch-dis.PNG)

### [Warcraft Logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com) Last Three Logs

To get the last three of your guild's logs, use:

```
!logs
```

### [Warcraft Logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com) Last Three Logs (Classic WoW)

To get the last three of your guild's logs, use:

```
!logsc

List out a character's gear, including heart of azeroth level. Links to the Wowhead page for the gear.
```
!gearlist characterName

## Server Enhancement Commands

NinjaBot can greet people leaving the server, and notify the server when someone leaves. The messages the bot uses are customizable.

Visit the [NinjaBot website](https://www.gngrninja.com/ninjabot-command-reference/2017/6/13/admin-commands) for more information.

## Help!

If you're having trouble using any of the WoW commands, the first thing to try is re-associating your WoW guild with your Discord server.
If that doesn't help, check out the following resources below:
